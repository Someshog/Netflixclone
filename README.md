Netflix Clone

Overview:
The clone closely resembles the appearance and layout of the Netflix homepage, featuring elements such as the navigation bar, hero section with featured content, carousel of movie or TV show thumbnails, and a footer section. The design is responsive, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Features:
As users scroll through the website, they can discover more about its features and functionalities. An FAQ section is included, providing answers to commonly asked questions about account management, content availability, device compatibility, and more analogous to netflix's homepage.

Technologies Used:
Frontend - HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Backend - Node.js, Express.js.

Getting Started:
1) Clone the Repository.
2) Navigate to the Project Directory.
3) Open index.html located in the project folder in your browser.
4) To track user interactions and handle post requests effectively, we'll integrate Express.js into our project: npm install express.
5) Organize Project Structure: To maintain a clean project structure, create a public folder where all static assets (HTML, CSS, client-side JavaScript) will reside. Keep the server.js file outside the public folder to secure server-side logic.
6) Now, run the command: npm start server.js.
7) App should be listening on port 3000.
